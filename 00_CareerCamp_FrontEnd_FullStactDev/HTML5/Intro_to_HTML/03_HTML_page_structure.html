        <h1>HTML Page Structure</h1>
        <pre>
            The < html > < /html > tags must begin and end the document.
            < html > This tag and its end tag must be the first tag (after the Doctype) and 
            the last tag in your document. 
            It tells the browser that everything within these tags should be viewed 
            as HTML-coded information and should be parsed accordingly by the browser.
        </pre>
            <h3>1. Head</h3>
            <pre>
                < head > 
                This tag and its end tag sets apart the section of your document 
                that will not be visible on your web page but helps the browser in 
                working with the document. Many different tags can be placed within 
                the < head> tags, but in our example above we only have the required tag,
                

                < title > 
                This is an identifier for the overall content of a document. 
                This is not displayed within your web page, but (usually) at the top of 
                your browser application's window titlebar. For example, this web page's 
                < title> is "ETS - HTML Basics - Structure" as you can see by looking at 
                the titlebar of this browser window. This title is also displayed in a 
                browser's history and bookmarks, so it is best to be descriptive with 
                this tag so that it will understandable out of context.

                < meta > tag
                Contains machine-readable information (metadata) about the document
            </pre>
            <h3>2. Body</h3>
            <pre>
                < body> This tag contains all elements of your document that will appear 
                within a browser's window. This is the content of your document and is 
                where the majority of HTML tags will be placed.
